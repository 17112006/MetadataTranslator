GENERAL

To upgrade from the previous version:

Deploy MetadataTranslator-${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-r${buildNumber}.war 
to the servlet container where MetadataTranslator was previously running. 

UPGRADING FROM ANY EARLIER VERSION TO 1.4

The following optional context parameters can now be set:

	- 'nl.mpi.metadatatranslator.handleResolutionCacheExpiry'

		It determines the amount of time to keep handle resolution results (in seconds).
		Set to 0 to disable caching. Default value is 600 (ten minutes).
	
	- 'nl.mpi.translation.imdi2cmdiXSLT'
	
		Path on the local file system to the (master) IMDI to CMDI stylesheet. Leave empty
		or unspecified to fall back to internal stylesheet 'imdi2cmdi.xslt'.
	
	- 'nl.mpi.translation.cmdi2imdiXSLT'

		Path on the local file system to the (master) CMDI to IMDI stylesheet. Leave empty
		or unspecified to fall back to internal stylesheet 'cmdi2imdiMaster.xslt'.
		
Using the latter two parameters, stylesheets can be maintained outside the application
context, allowing for fixes and other updates without redeploying the translation service.
To bootstrap this, copy the embedded stylesheets from the 'xslt-templates' directory
in this package. Notice that these are *not* used by the application by default, as it
takes by default the stylesheets packaged as resources in the metadata-translator JAR.
